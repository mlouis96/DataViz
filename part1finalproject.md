## Project Brief

**Summary**

 In brief I would like to create a data visualization emphasizing the need for political content moderation due to the prevalence of misinformation and hate speech on social media platforms. our minds have been primed to pick up extreme and oftentimes negative headlines while scrolling through social media. Social media plays an important role in helping us build communities and connecting us with the larger world, though the diversity of the content we see online has created divergent experiences for different groups using SMP. Personalized feeds designed by complex algorithms (we do not understand)  have led to a  behavioral change that didn't happen overnight, leading to effects that have permanently changed the way we think and behave. These algorithms are designed to make individuals stay on respective platforms longer, so it's no surprise that extreme content is what makes its way into our social feeds. 

Some of the direct effects of poor moderation of social media, is Facebook's involvement in Myanmar, increased polarization, YouTube’s recommendation algorithm’s effect on Bolsonaro’s election. 

I would like to visualize some of the negative effects of poor content moderation, the inherent biases we have that affect our behavior while using social media, and perhaps the way the AI works behind the scenes.

**Project Outline**

Setup:
Misinformation and hate speech is rampant on social media.

Conflict: 

Its impact on political messaging is creating polarization
Increase in offline hate crimes
There is a long term behavior change
Echo chambers are preventing us from getting diverse perspectives
Algorithms have a part to play in curating problematic content

While explaining the ‘conflict’ I also plan to weave in examples to further drill down on the points of conflict. 

Resolution: 
Social Media platforms need to take better action to prevent hate speech and misinformation.
