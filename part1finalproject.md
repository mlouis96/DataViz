# Part I: Final project

## An outline

###### In brief I would like to create a data visualization emphasizing the need for political content moderation due to the prevalence of misinformation and hate speech on social media platforms. 

Setup:
Misinformation and hate speech is rampant on social media.

Conflict: 
1. Its impact on political messaging is creating polarization
2. increase in offline hate crimes.
3. There is a long term behavior change
4. cho chambers are preventing us from getting diverse perspectives. 
5. algorithms have a part to play in curating problematic content
