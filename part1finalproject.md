## Project Brief

**Summary**

 In brief I would like to create a data visualization emphasizing the need for political content moderation due to the prevalence of misinformation and hate speech on social media platforms. our minds have been primed to pick up extreme and oftentimes negative headlines while scrolling through social media. Social media plays an important role in helping us build communities and connecting us with the larger world, though the diversity of the content we see online has created divergent experiences for different groups using SMP. Personalized feeds designed by complex algorithms (we do not understand)  have led to a  behavioral change that didn't happen overnight, leading to effects that have permanently changed the way we think and behave. These algorithms are designed to make individuals stay on respective platforms longer, so it's no surprise that extreme content is what makes its way into our social feeds. 

Some of the direct effects of poor moderation of social media, is Facebook's involvement in Myanmar, increased polarization, YouTube’s recommendation algorithm’s effect on Bolsonaro’s election. 

I would like to visualize some of the negative effects of poor content moderation, the inherent biases we have that affect our behavior while using social media, and perhaps the way the AI works behind the scenes. 


Some of the direct effects poor moderation of social media, is Facebook's involvment in Myanmmar 

**Project Outline**

Setup:
Misinformation and hate speech is rampant on social media.

Conflict: 

Its impact on political messaging is creating polarization.
Increase in offline hate crimes.
There is a long term behavior change.
Echo chambers are preventing us from getting diverse perspectives.
Algorithms have a part to play in curating problematic content.

While explaining the ‘conflict’ I also plan to weave in examples to further drill down on the points of conflict. 

Resolution: 
Social Media platforms need to take better action to prevent hate speech and misinformation.

## The data

Preliminary sources that I have started to collect, theses in include quantitative datasets

| Date Title | How will it be Used | source |
| US Politicians Political Dataset | This data will be used to show the number of politicians using social media platforms | [Link Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mrmorj/us-politicians-twitter-dataset/)  |
| Social Media Posts from US Politicians| This data will be used to analyze bias, and types of messaging by politcans | [Link Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishidamarla/social-media-posts-from-us-politicians/) |
| How News Appears on Social Media | The data needs to be tagged by looking at words used in headlines, the idea for this dataset is to find patterns in the ways headlines are communicated in order to see if there's variations is headlines in traditional media vs. social media | [Link Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/socialmedianews/how-news-appears-on-social-media/) |
|News Popularity in Multiple Social Media Platforms Data Set | Data to be visualized to show which news sources are shared on which platforms under different categories | [Link Here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/News+Popularity+in+Multiple+Social+Media+Platforms/)|




Some data that is qualitative that I can work on make visuals for 

| Article/Paper Title | How will it be Used | source  |
| Double Standards in Social Media Content Moderation | Article has info that can be used to show algorithm bias, and existing moderation methods| https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/double-standards-social-media-content-moderation  |
| Social Media Posts from US Politicians| This data will be used to analyze bias, and types of messaging by politcans   | https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rishidamarla/social-media-posts-from-us-politicians |
| Social Media Effects| Information from this article can be used to illustrate polarization and bias | https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7343248/ |



## Method and medium

The method I will be using to create the visuals will be mostly limited to Flourish and Tableau, I will be using Shorthand to compile the visuals with the text.
