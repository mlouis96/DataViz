## An outline

###### In brief I would like to create a data visualization emphasizing the need for political content moderation due to the prevalence of misinformation and hate speech on social media platforms. our minds have been primed to pick up extreme and oftentimes negative headlines while scrolling through social media. Social media plays an important role in helping us build communities and connecting us with the larger world, though the diversity of the content we see online has created divergent experiences for different groups using SMP. Personalized feeds designed by complex algorithms (we do not understand)  have led to a  behavioral change that didn't happen overnight, leading to effects that have permanently changed the way we think and behave. These algorithms are designed to make individuals stay on respective platforms longer, so it's no surprise that extreme content is what makes its way into our social feeds. 

Project Outline

###### Setup:
Misinformation and hate speech is rampant on social media.

###### Conflict: 
1. Its impact on political messaging is creating polarization
2. increase in offline hate crimes.
3. There is a long term behavior change
4. cho chambers are preventing us from getting diverse perspectives. 
5. algorithms have a part to play in curating problematic content

###### Resolution:
Social Media platforms need to take better action to prevent hate speech and misinformation.
