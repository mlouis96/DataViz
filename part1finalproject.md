# Part I: Final project

## An outline

###### In brief I would like to create a data visualization emphasizing the need for political content moderation due to the prevalence of misinformation and hate speech on social media platforms. 

Setup:
Misinformation and hate speech is rampant on social media.

Conflict: 
-Its impact on political messaging is creating polarization
- increase in offline hate crimes.
-There is a long term behavior change
-echo chambers are preventing us from getting diverse perspectives. 
-algorithms have a part to play in curating problematic content
