# Introduction

Building off the outline that I developed in part 1, I further elaborated on the storyline and sketched out all of the data visualizations that I wanted to make. This helped me decide if I should potentially try new styles in future iterations without investing too much time to make all of them on flourish or Tableau. This would also help me test the overall storyline and see if I needed to make any changes to the story which would help alert me to any other diagrams I would need to make. 

I struggled to tell the story in a concise way, I think I have a lot of data that is qualitative and It is hard for me to find a way to communicate this in a convincing way to the audience to inspire the call to action. I am still trying to flesh those parts a bit more. These pertain to specific examples where lack of political content moderation led to crimes against minorities that are both running for elections and individuals.

Some information is still to be added, as I figure out the best way to discuss post ranking algorithms and how content that generates the most reactions, which also tends to be more polarizing content or extreme content gets pushed to the tops of our feeds.

# User Research 

My target audience is both the average social media user and platform designers. I believe it would be important to emphasize the way platforms work, by being informed individuals can make better decisions on how they obtain and share their news.

I identified three users:

Male 24, an individual with a background in philosophy 
Female 26, a graduate student with a background in engineering
Female 27, an individual with a background in design
