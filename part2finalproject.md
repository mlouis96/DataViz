# Introduction

Building off the outline that I developed in part 1, I further elaborated on the storyline and sketched out all of the data visualizations that I wanted to make. This helped me decide if I should potentially try new styles in future iterations without investing too much time to make all of them on flourish or Tableau. This would also help me test the overall storyline and see if I needed to make any changes to the story which would help alert me to any other diagrams I would need to make. 

I struggled to tell the story in a concise way, I think I have a lot of data that is qualitative and It is hard for me to find a way to communicate this in a convincing way to the audience to inspire the call to action. I am still trying to flesh those parts a bit more. These pertain to specific examples where lack of political content moderation led to crimes against minorities that are both running for elections and individuals.

Some information is still to be added, as I figure out the best way to discuss post ranking algorithms and how content that generates the most reactions, which also tends to be more polarizing content or extreme content gets pushed to the tops of our feeds. 


# Wireframe
This is a rough outline of the visuals and the content I wanted to touch upon. There are a few more elements I need to think through

Some visuals I worked on developing higher fidelities

# User Research 


My target audience is both the average social media user and platform designers. I believe it would be important to emphasize the way platforms work, by being informed individuals can make better decisions on how they obtain and share their news.

I identified three users:

Male 24, an individual with a background in philosophy 
Female 26, a graduate student with a background in engineering
Female 27, an individual with a background in design

The interview protocol:

Since I had to incorporate a few more parts into my visual I narrated the story while showing the relevant visuals to the users.

What is the main message of this story? what is communicated well, what could be better?
Do the visuals complement the story?
Do you have another other feedback?

After the entire presentation, I also asked the following questions:

Did you feel like the flow of the story made sense? 
What were parts you wish were different? 
Was there anything you wanted to learn more about after going through the story? (to understand if there were more points I could touch upon)


# Key Takeaways 

While presentating I noticed some disconnects in certain sections. The case on 

###### Male 24
Felt that the order could be modified to highlight more of why specifically political content creates or activates hate crimes. Liked seeing the comparison in the types of political headlines varied on LinkedIn vs Facebook. Also posed the question that the user demographics could play a part in how the content is shared, could there be different methods for different age groups.

###### Female 26
Felt that a compelling argument should be built around showing how content moderation is helpful since there is an example on Myanmmar showing the effects of lack of moderation.

###### Female 27

Understood the main message, but suggested the arrangement of the visuals could be different. Thought the political side could be elaborated on upfront and then the effects on biases and examples could be shared afterwards as supporting pieces to the main argument.


Limitations on lack of fidelity of the visuals could have also played a part in how the overall story was perceived. 



# Updates for Next Iteration 

I need to add headlines to the visuals that help convey the message a bit more clearly, and work on delivering a more solid story. Some more data needs to be added regarding the positive and negative effects of moderation to make the story have multiple perspectives.
