Just as the clickbait title of this article got your attention, we find that our minds have been primed to pick up extreme and, often, negative headlines while scrolling through social media. While social media has played an essential role in helping us build communities and connecting us with the larger world, the diversity of online content has created divergent experiences for different groups using social media platforms. Personalized feeds designed by complex algorithms (we do not understand) have led to behavioral changes that didn’t happen overnight and have permanently changed how we think and behave. These algorithms, designed to make our stay on respective platforms longer, have found that pushing extreme content into our social feeds is one way to achieve this. Fringe groups (such as anti-vaxxers) that otherwise would not get any media coverage are suddenly in the spotlight, and people who are usually able to discern fact from fiction, begin to believe the misinformation they see online.


I believe platforms can instigate change in their culture by creating environments that might prevent the spread of abuse and misinformation. You can read more about in my article (linked here) which aims to examine social media’s effect on political discourse. The importance of improving interactions with political content on social media, the steps users could take to ensure the information they view is accurate, and what platforms should be held responsible for.

The purpose of this page is to visalise impacts of social media on politics

Political misinformation has always been around but never so widely spread. Before the advent of social media, individuals would gather around their televisions to observe political discourse or grab a newspaper to catch up on the times. Changes became more pronounced with the birth of the internet; digital technology helped people view static documents and communicate and share the views of politicians easily and more frequently. At the same time, the mechanisms that were used to display on the different mediums saw a shift. Barack Obama’s social media strategy revolutionized how other politicians after him would use social media to mobilize, recruit and influence voters.
Social media platforms differ from other digital channels because of how individuals interact with content. The existence of influencers and followers creates an interesting space where followers begin to identify with influencers on a personal level, enabling influential individuals (such as Trump) to post abusive or fake content but still be supported.


###### Using a Dataset that looks at Headlines from news sources shared through each platform, we see that on Facebook there is a much higher proportion of headlines pertaining to politics that are being shared. While the results from Linkedin and GooglePlus are not surprising. Looking at this visual we can see that out of all the headlines individuals could have shared on Facebook political headlines beats out other categories, indicating social media is indeed a huge space where individuals share their political beliefs. 

###### Of the sources that are shared, Breitbart News articles were shared the most on Facebook. Breitnart has published a number of conspiracy theories and intentionally misleading stories. When we compare the type of poitlical content shared on Facebook versus LinkeIn we see a huge differnce in the type of sources shared.

###### Source: This is a subset of the dataset of the same name available in the UCI Machine Learning Repository
The collected data relates to a period of 8 months, between November 2015 and July 2016, accounting for about 100,000 news items on four different topics: economy, microsoft, obama and palestine.

From my research studying why hateful content is spread more frequently online, I came across several authors illustrating how the algorthms constantlty push negative content similar to the title of this post. To measure the prevalence of negative headlines I wanted to compare if negativity in headlines resulted in an increased engagement on platforms. 

To study this I found a dataset that contained news headlines shared on social media, and the engagement each headline received. I still needed to analyse the sentiment of these headlines. In order to do this I used python to conduct a sentiment analysis

and used a scale from -1 to 1 to classify the posts as negative, neutral or positive
